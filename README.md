# Bogo in C

This is pretty much a "translation" from the [Python engine][1]. We plan to make
this version the common code base for all supported platforms.

We have to move away from Python since there is no viable method of running
Python on [Firefox OS][2] (effectively a browser). We choose C because it runs
on all desktop operating systems and can be compiled to Javascript/ams.js through
[Emscripten][3]. In case one of us feel like supporting iOS or Android then it
would still be straightforward.

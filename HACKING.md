## Naming Convention

There are two classes of special markings used in Vietnamese.
We use the word 'tone' to refer to marks on vowels that change
their pitch. There are 6 such tones in Vietnamese:

* hanging, marked by a grave (à)
* sharp, marked by an acute mark (á)
* asking, marked by a hook (ả)
* tumbling, marked by a tilde (ã)
* heavy, marked by an under dot (ạ), and finally
* level or no tone

The other kind of marks are ones that create new letters from
existing ones. We call these simply 'marks'.

* circumflex, or hat (^) used in â, ê, ô
* breve, used in ă
* horn, used in ư, ơ
* dash, used in đ
